<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Community Led Action and Partnership (CLAP) project started work in August 2020, in M-Ward, Mumbai, during the first wave of the Corona virus pandemic. The project centres around a community led approach to addresses the vulnerabilities of people in informal settlements, and empowers them to cope with disasters through an effective primary level redressal. Piloting such a model in a large informal settlement in Mumbai will be a learning site for other cities with informal settlement populations.
	
<p>This webpage documents the process and the data collated and created by the CLAP Project from August 2020 to May 2021. It contains links to the survey data and several sub-projects including ration card, relief activities, vulnerability index etc.
