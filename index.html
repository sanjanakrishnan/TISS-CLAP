    Partnership</h1>


  <h2>About the Project</h2>
  <p>CLAP proposes a community led approach that addresses the vulnerabilities of people in informal settlements,
    educates them to move away from the fear and stigma surrounding COVID and empowers them to cope with it through an
    effective primary level redressal, thereby reducing the mortality among the positive cases is thus considered
    necessary. Piloting such a model in a large informal settlement in Mumbai will be a learning site for other cities
    with informal settlement populations.</p>

    2021. It contains links to the survey data and several sub-projects including ration card, relief activities,
